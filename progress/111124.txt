1. commented the header and hero-img-container component in content.js
2/ created a custom carousel component and moved the content with in the header inside the carousel.
Brought the carousel from the bootstrap components

3. imported the carousel component inside the content.js

4. adding some custom styling to carousel, while commented out the header and hero-img-section styling in content.css

classes commented in content.css:
.hero-image-containe
.hero-image-container img:first-child
.img1
.img2
.img3
.hero-image-container img
.header

5. Created a copy of Content.js component and called it HomePage.js component. Copied the content of Content.js into homepage.js and adjusted the import paths.

In App.js, used component HomePage instead of Content.js

6. Archieved the Header.js component as it is not being used in App.js, rather the Navbar component is being called directly in App.js

7. Added component directories for AboutPage, Mission, JoinUs

8. Copied content.css into all components AboutPage, Mission, JoinUs and renamed it as per the directory name

9. Took content of HomePage.js and split the div sections into the specific components of AboutPage, Mission, JoinUs

10. Cleaned up the contents of components and css of AboutPage, Mission, JoinUs and HomePage components.
Kept each section specific to its component.

11. Now added route for each component: AboutPage, Mission, JoinUs and HomePage components in App.js. Import statements were added carefully.

12. In App.js, commented out the use of Navbar component.

13. Created a directory for general components. Moved the components along with the respective css and images of general components : 
Navbar and Footer.

14. Now since the use of Navbar was commented in App.js, i imported the Navbar from general components and used it in each of AboutPage, Mission, JoinUs and HomePage components

15. Pulled Carousel out of the HomePage and made it a general component.
Instead of hard-coding the image sources, I made Carousel component take in a prop of images array
This way carousel can be reused in the project.
Homepage -> imported the images there instead of Carousel component and made an array of them and passed them to carousel.

Carousel now instead of having a hardcoded slides, uses map function of arrays to dynamicall map each image into bootstrap slide class.

16. pulled the custom class of .custom-carousel-img from content.css and moved it into a new file called Carousel.css in general components directory and adjusted css imports in carousel.js

17. Renamed Content.css in HomePage directory to HomePage.css and adjusted the imports of css in HomePage component.

18. Added a HeroSection component after Navbar in HomePage. I used the hero section from bootstrap

19. Created a FeatureSection Component. Used Grid from bootstrap in it.
