1. react-router-dom
npm install react-router-dom

Purpose: This library is used for handling routing in a React application. It enables you to navigate between different pages or views within a single-page application (SPA) without needing to reload the browser.
Usage: You can use react-router-dom to define routes for different components and handle navigation between them (e.g., Route, Link, useHistory, useLocation).
Example:

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

<Router>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
  </Routes>
</Router>


2. axios
npm install axios

Purpose: axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It is used to make asynchronous requests to an API or server (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Usage: It simplifies making HTTP requests, handling responses, and catching errors, making it a popular choice for interacting with REST APIs.
Example:

import axios from 'axios';

axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });

3. jwt-decode
npm install jwt-decode

Purpose: This is a simple library for decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are commonly used for authentication in web applications, and this library helps you decode the payload of a JWT without verifying its signature.
Usage: Useful for extracting user information (such as user ID or roles) stored in the token after a user logs in.
Example:

import jwt_decode from 'jwt-decode';

const token = 'your-jwt-token';
const decoded = jwt_decode(token);
console.log(decoded); // { userId: 123, role: 'admin' }

4. @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
npm install @fortawesome/react-fontawesome

Purpose: This is the official React component library for Font Awesome, which is a popular icon set. It allows you to use Font Awesome icons in your React components as React components.
Usage: You can import and use Font Awesome icons in your React components for UI elements like buttons, headers, etc.
Example:

import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';
import { faCoffee } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

<FontAwesomeIcon icon={faCoffee} />

5. @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons

Purpose: This package includes the free set of solid icons from Font Awesome. It provides a collection of icons that you can use in your React application with @fortawesome/react-fontawesome.
Usage: Used in combination with @fortawesome/react-fontawesome to import specific icons (like faCoffee, faHome, etc.).
Example:

import { faHome } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

6. react-chartjs-2
npm install react-chartjs-2

Purpose: A React wrapper for the popular Chart.js library, which allows you to create interactive charts and graphs in your React applications. react-chartjs-2 integrates Chart.js with React, allowing you to easily render charts in your React components.
Usage: You can use this library to create various types of charts, including line charts, bar charts, and pie charts.
Example:

import { Line } from 'react-chartjs-2';
import { Chart as ChartJS, CategoryScale, LinearScale, LineElement, PointElement } from 'chart.js';

ChartJS.register(CategoryScale, LinearScale, LineElement, PointElement);

const data = {
  labels: ['January', 'February', 'March'],
  datasets: [{
    label: 'Sales',
    data: [65, 59, 80],
    borderColor: 'rgba(75,192,192,1)',
    fill: false,
  }],
};

<Line data={data} />

7. chart.js
npm install chart.js

Purpose: chart.js is a JavaScript library for creating various types of charts (e.g., line, bar, radar) in a web page. It is the core charting library that powers react-chartjs-2.
Usage: You can use chart.js directly to configure and draw charts, or indirectly via react-chartjs-2 for React-based integrations.
Example:

import Chart from 'chart.js/auto';

new Chart(document.getElementById('myChart'), {
  type: 'line',
  data: {
    labels: ['January', 'February', 'March'],
    datasets: [{
      label: 'My Dataset',
      data: [65, 59, 80],
    }],
  },
});

In Summary:

react-router-dom: Used for routing and navigation within a React application.

axios: Used for making HTTP requests (API calls) from a React application.

jwt-decode: Used to decode JSON Web Tokens and extract data from them.

@fortawesome/react-fontawesome: A React component wrapper for Font Awesome icons.

@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons: A set of free solid icons from Font Awesome for use with react-fontawesome.

react-chartjs-2: A React wrapper for the Chart.js library to easily integrate charts into your React app.

chart.js: The underlying JavaScript library for creating charts, used by react-chartjs-2.

Each of these libraries serves a different purpose but can work together in your project depending on the features you need (e.g., routing, charts, HTTP requests, authentication, and icons).
