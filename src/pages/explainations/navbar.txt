The following Bootstrap classes each perform specific functions in styling a navbar:

navbar: This class is used to create a responsive navigation bar. It applies a basic layout and styling for the navbar element, typically including positioning, padding, and font styling.

navbar-expand-lg: This class makes the navbar responsive. The navbar-expand-lg class means the navbar will be expanded (displayed horizontally) on large screens and larger (breakpoint lg and above). On smaller screens, the navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu by default.

navbar-light: This class applies a light color scheme to the navbar, which is typically used when the background color is light (like bg-light). It adjusts the text and link colors for contrast against a light background, ensuring readability.

bg-light: This class applies a light background color to the navbar. The background will be a very light shade, often a soft grey or off-white, depending on the theme.

Together, these classes create a navbar that is light in color, expands to a horizontal layout on large screens, and collapses into a vertical menu on smaller screens.


1. container-fluid
Purpose: This class is used to create a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport. Unlike container, which has fixed width depending on the screen size, container-fluid ensures that the content always takes up 100% of the width, regardless of the screen size.
Example:
<div class="container-fluid">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>

2. navbar-brand
Purpose: The navbar-brand class is typically used to define the brand or logo part of the navbar. It is usually linked to the homepage of the website, providing a clickable element (such as a logo or text) that users can click to return to the main page.
Example:
<a class="navbar-brand" href="#">My Website</a>

3. collapse
Purpose: This class is used to hide elements that can be toggled (e.g., collapsible menu). When combined with other classes like navbar-collapse or a button with data-toggle="collapse", it makes an element collapsible or expandable.
Example:
<div class="collapse" id="navbarNav">
  <ul class="navbar-nav">
    <!-- Navigation items -->
  </ul>
</div>
The collapse class hides the element, and it can be shown or hidden via JavaScript.

4. navbar-collapse
Purpose: This class is applied to the container of the collapsible navbar content (usually a list of navigation links). It ensures that the content collapses on smaller screens and expands on larger ones when combined with collapse and navbar-toggler.
Example:

<div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
  <ul class="navbar-nav">
    <!-- Navigation items -->
  </ul>
</div>
When the navbar toggler button is clicked, this content will collapse or expand.

5. navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0
Purpose: This class is applied to the unordered list (<ul>) inside the navbar, and it has multiple parts:
navbar-nav: Applies Bootstrap's navbar styling to the list, turning it into a proper navigation menu.
me-auto: A utility class that uses the "margin-end" property to automatically push the navbar items to the left, creating spacing on the right side. This is a Bootstrap 5 shorthand for margin-left (ml-auto) in RTL (right-to-left) languages.
mb-2: A margin-bottom of 0.5rem on small screens (mobile), to provide some spacing.
mb-lg-0: Removes the margin-bottom (0rem) on large screens, to avoid extra spacing on larger devices.
Example:
<ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0">
  <!-- Navigation items -->
</ul>

6. nav-item
Purpose: The nav-item class is applied to each list item (<li>) inside a navbar-nav. It ensures that the list items are styled correctly as part of the navigation bar.
Example:
<li class="nav-item">
  <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home</a>
</li>

7. nav-link
Purpose: The nav-link class is applied to each anchor (<a>) inside a nav-item. It provides the default styling for navigation links in Bootstrap, such as font styles, colors, and padding. It also handles hover effects.
Example:
<a class="nav-link" href="#">Home</a>
